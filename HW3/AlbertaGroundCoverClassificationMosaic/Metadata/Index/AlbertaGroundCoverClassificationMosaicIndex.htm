  <meta name="dc.description" content="This dataset is produced for the Government of Alberta and is available to the general public. Please consult the Distribution Information of this metadata for the appropriate contact to acquire this dataset.  The Alberta Ground Cover Classification Mosaic Status captures information about the Landsat scenes that were used to create the Alberta Ground Cover Classification, which is part of the Alberta Ground Cover Classification Mosaic.  The Alberta Ground Cover Classification Mosaic is a composite of the Alberta Ground Cover Classification (AGCC) created by Alberta Environment and Sustainable Resource Development and the Land Cover for Agricultural Regions of Canada, circa 2000 created by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.  The AGCC is an inventory produced for the Green Area of the province. This dataset was merged with the landcover inventory produced for the Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) for the White Area of the Province.  The Land Cover for Agricultural Regions of Canada, circa 2000 is the most accurate dataset for the White Area of the Province and it was recoded to the AGCC system in order to facilitate modelling for the entire province. The Alberta Ground Cover Classification (AGCC) represents the Government of Alberta's comprehensive biophysical, anthropogenic and land-use inventory for the Green area of the Province of Alberta. The compilation of the inventory commenced in 1999 in the north east area of the province. The project used satellite imagery captured by the United Stated Geological Survey using the Landsat 5 satellite for the time period between July 21, 1999 and August 23, 2002. Data was created by the classification of six project areas beginning in the North-east ending in the south until all of the vegetation in the green zone of the Province was captured. The Alberta Ground Cover Classification was developed using funds from the Earth Observation Pilots Projects Program (EOP3) initiative funded by the Canadian Space Agency. A pilot project was launched to develop a multi-user, ground cover classification schema to be applied province-wide inventory which was suitable for a broad range of Alberta Environmental Protection (present ESRD) needs. The project purpose was to design and develop a province wide multi user satellite based ground cover classification for the province to provide reconnaissance for operational resource applications. The Alberta program was geared to meet regional needs pertaining to vegetation mapping, wildlife habitat assessment, forest fuel mapping, and to monitoring long-term landscape change. The Alberta EOP3 classification scheme emphasized forest and other vegetation communities while considering Natural Region differences. Study sites and/or areas were selected from each of the 5 major natural regions and from each of the associated subregions excluding the Alpine subregion. The AGCC product is a comprehensive and detailed geospatial representation of land cover that is intended to meet a multitude of business needs integral to land-use planning and management in Alberta. The AGCC is a biophysical and land-use inventory rather than a purely vegetation inventory. The AGCC is a classified landscape raster dataset compiled from the Landsat 7 and Landsat 5 satellite bands. The characteristics of pixels of the imagery enable the analyst to perform the interpretation of the spectral signatures of the vegetation. This process is the key to the creation of the basic map units in the creation of the AGCC Inventory digital product. These land use classes within the AGCC raster datasets represent interpretations of relatively uniform biophysical or anthropogenic areas. The AGCC site type classification is captured under the values column in the AGCC class table. The AGCC has both vegetative and anthropogenic classes. Their associated information and the data capture methodology are described in the AGCC Classification for the Province of Alberta Specifications document.  The AGCC (Code) Class are as follows:  (0) No Data  (10) Undifferentiated Anthropogenic  (11) Urban  (12) Commercial and Industrial  (13) Major Road, Highway and Railway  (15) Surface Mine, Gravel Pit and Spoil Pile  (20) Undifferentiated Agriculture  (21) Cropland  (30) Undifferentiated Clearcut  (31) Graminoid Dominated Clearcut (32) Tree/Shrub Dominated Clearcut  (33) Tree Dominated Clearcut (40) Undifferentiated Burn  (41) Graminoid Dominated Burn (42) Tree/Shrub dominated Burn  (43) Tree dominated Burn  (44) New Burn  (50) Closed Fir  (51) Closed Black Spruce  (52) Closed Pine  (53) Closed Engelmann/White Spruce  (54) Closed Undifferentiated Conifer  (55) Closed Aspen/Balsam Poplar/Birch  (56) Closed Coniferous Dominated Mixedwood  (57) Closed Deciduous Dominated Mixedwood  (58) Closed Coniferous and Deciduous Cover  (61) Closed Riparian Shrub  (63) Closed Upland Shrub  (71) Fescue Grassland  (72) Mixed Grassland  (81) Emergent Wetland  (82) Graminoid Wetland  (83) Shrubby Wetland  (85) Lichen Bog  (86) Black Spruce Bog (88) Undifferentiated Wetland  (91) Lake, Pond, Reservoir, River and Stream  (101) Permanent Ice and Snow  (102) Rock, Talus and Avalanche Chute  (103) Exposed Soil  (105) Upland Dune Field  (112) Cloud/Haze  (113) Shadow  (150) Open Fir  (151) Open Black Spruce  (152) Open Pine  (153) Open Engelmann/White Spruce  (154) Open Undifferentiated Conifer  (155) Open Aspen/Balsam Poplar/Birch  (158) Open Coniferous and Deciduous Cover  (163) Open Upland Shrub The AGCC projects were initially funded under the Forest Fuels Acquisition for the Wildfire Operations Branch of the Forestry Division. The primary funding agency is Alberta Environment and Sustainable Resource Development. The AGCC Inventory data, index map, and specifications documents are available from Alberta Environment and Sustainable Resource Development, Government of Alberta. The Land Cover for Agricultural Regions of Canada, circa 2000 is a 30 metre resolution raster format land cover classification produced from Landsat satellite imagery. Mapping is complete for agricultural regions of Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia. The Product is available based on corresponding UTM Zones.  Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) has compiled land cover mapping for agricultural regions across Canada, with the goal of accurately classifying lands at a moderate scale that are annually cultivated (cropland), permanently cultivated (pasture/forages), and grasslands; as well as mapping other contextual classes (such as built-up or forested lands). The purpose is to provide information that can be used to support land use decision making and a range of other agri-environmental federal, provincial, municipal and private projects, applications, programs and activities. Some examples of potential applications are: land use decision making and monitoring, impact assessment on ecosystem services, biodiversity conservation, water quality assessment, evaluation of temporal trends in surface properties, estimates of rates of change, and causes and consequences of change.

The Alberta Ground Cover Classification Mosaic Status captures information about the Landsat scenes that were used to create the Alberta Ground Cover Classification, which is part of the Alberta Ground Cover Classification Mosaic.  The Alberta Ground Cover Classification Mosaic is a composite of the Alberta Ground Cover Classification (AGCC) created by Alberta Environment and Sustainable Resource Development and the Land Cover for Agricultural Regions of Canada, circa 2000 created by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.  The AGCC is an inventory produced for the Green Area of the province. This dataset was merged with the landcover inventory produced for the Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) for the White Area of the Province.  The Land Cover for Agricultural Regions of Canada, circa 2000 is the most accurate dataset for the White Area of the Province and it was recoded to the AGCC system in order to facilitate modelling for the entire province.
